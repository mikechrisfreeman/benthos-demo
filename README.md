# Benthos demo
This repo aims to demo the capabilities of [Benthos](https://www.benthos.dev/). 

Benthos (from Ancient Greek βένθος (bénthos) 'the depths (of the sea)'), also known as benthon, is the community of organisms that live on, in, or near the bottom of a sea, river, lake, or stream, also known as the benthic zone.

Benthos is a declarative data streaming service that solves a wide range of data engineering problems with simple, chained, stateless processing steps. It implements transaction based resiliency with back pressure, so when connecting to at-least-once sources and sinks it's able to guarantee at-least-once delivery without needing to persist messages during transit.
